  <h1>FlickPick API Documentation</h1>
  <div>
    <p>This project is about building a server-side component of a "movies"
      web application which will provide users with access to information
      about different concert movies, directors, and genres.<br>
      Users will be able to perform <strong>CRUD</strong> operations on their
      personal information and <strong>create</strong> a list of their favorite movies.
